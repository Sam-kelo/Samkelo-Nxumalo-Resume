<h2>About</h2>

	<p>I am an analytical, result-driven individual who is keen on utilizing the
	skills and knowledge attained through education and experience in
	various fields. This also includes an exceptional systematic approach
	when tackling tasks with the ability to take initiative where need be.</p>
	
	<p> I  have always found the world of technology and development very interesting. This interest was sparked
	by the devices I would then later interact with such as cellphones, Playstation consoles and laptops.
	With art being one of my core passions, the video game world was the most intriguing as it combined
	both tech and art. The way in which  all the elements in the virtual environment interacted so 
	seamlessly made me wonder what was going on in the background to make this all possible.</p>
